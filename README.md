# ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers

While taking the free course [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) I downloaded all the notebooks, so I could continue learning and playing with them.

Here I will add some other experiments and keep the sources I'm consulting or learning from.

I hope it will help anyone else in their journey to learn how to take advantage of LLMs better and upskill.
